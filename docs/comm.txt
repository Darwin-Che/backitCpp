# Client - Server Communication

This happens when the client calls `backit / backit ls`. 

The terminal shows a interactive text ui that is a temporal composition
of the remote fs with local fs. 

Each entry is one of the following type:

- local file/directory
- sync file (synced/unsynced)
- syncless dir (synced/unsynced)
- syncmore dir (synced/unsynced)
- remote file/dir

User Operations allowed are : 

- local file -> sync file (unsynced)
- local dir -> syncless dir (unsynced)
- local dir -> syncmore dir (unsynced)

- sync file (unsynced) -> sync file (synced)
- syncless dir (unsynced) -> syncless dir (synced)
- syncmore dir (unsynced) -> syncmore dir (synced)

- file (synced) -> remote
- dir (synced) [all content are remotable] -> remote

- remote file -> file (synced)
- remote dir -> syncless dir (synced) [all subdir are remote]
