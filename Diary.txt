The purpose is to write down the lessons learnt in application development.

When detailing the logic of the application, i.e. how server communicates with client, 
things can be tangled up. 

The reason is there are so many decisions to make, and there are associations between them.
So in the process of fixing the decisions, make sure to untangle the logic, be clear about the 
dependency between the decisions, and then work top-down.
